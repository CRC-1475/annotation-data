# Metaphor annotation data

This dataset consists of web annotation data that originates from the [CRC 1475 "Metaphors of Religion"](https://sfb1475.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en) in a collaborative effort by researchers from Ruhr University Bochum (RUB) and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). It includes metaphor analyses that have been created by scholars from the CRC's various research projects during its first funding period from 2022 to late 2025.


## Included Files


## Methods & Tools


## File format and structure

The annotation data is provided as an RDF dataset in N-Quad syntax.


## Known caveats

- The documents that are referenced in the annotation targets are not yet publicly available due to outstanding legal issues. However, the immediate textual context is included in each annotation.
- Authorship of annotations currently only includes pseudonyms instead of the annotators' full names.
- There is ongoing work on formalizing the inner structure of the annotation bodies in an ontology. The exact data layout is therefore expected to change in upcoming iterations of the data.
